##Getting started with OpenCV and Qt##

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2012-2013*

Two simple projects, made in Qt Creator, for getting started with the OpenCV library (version 2.4.3) and with Qt (version 4.7.4).

Before using both projects, you must open their `.pro` files and edit the path to the OpenCV library, which should be already installed on your computer.
